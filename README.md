# -Model-Persistence-Versioning-Pickle-Joblib-ONNX-
ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project demonstrates how to implement model persistence (saving & loading) and versioning for machine learning models.
It uses Pickle and Joblib for serialization and provides optional support for ONNX to enable cross-platform inference.

The project also includes a CLI tool for loading any model version and running predictions on new data.

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

Train multiple machine learning models

Save models using Pickle and Joblib (ONNX optional)

Implement versioning (v1, v2, â€¦)

Store metadata in a config.json file

Load specific versions and run predictions via CLI
